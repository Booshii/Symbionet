This project was developed as part of my bachelor's thesis. It is a web application for a corporate network that supports the implementation of industrial symbiosis. The application serves as a basic framework and provides interfaces for additional components. Its main functions include user management with a login and admin area, as well as the publication and tracking of measures in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  
 Other modules associated with the project include an internal marketplace for materials and services, a dashboard for sustainable energy production, and a material database with LCA data.
